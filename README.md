Write a web server that accepts request to the '/' url and responds with a string of the **current time**.

### Setup
1. Create a new project directory
1. Scaffold a new, empty express project with `yo refactoru-express`


### Running
1. Start the server with `node app.js` (or `nodemon app.js` to automatically restart the server when app.js changes)
1. Navigate in your browser to http://localhost:PORT/
1. You should see the current time displayed.
